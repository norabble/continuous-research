# Backlog

Deferred items, none scheduled. Each entry says why it matters and what
"done" is — enough to pick it up cold. (Security items come from the
2026-07-06 review of the release → distribution → execution process.)

## Security hardening (release/distribution)

- **Tag ruleset on `v*`** — tags are the trust anchor for `npx github:…#vX`
  and are mutable today; a moved tag executes on every instance's next cron
  with that instance's App token. Done = repo ruleset blocking tag update +
  deletion on `v*`.
- **Document SHA pinning as hardened mode** — `#<full-sha>` instead of
  `#vX.Y.Z` removes tag trust entirely. Done = adopting.md upgrade section
  offers it with the trade-off stated.
- **Reframe the vendored bundle as the hardened path** — `npx github:`
  installs devDependencies and runs lifecycle scripts with the App token in
  env; the committed bundle runs zero install at runtime. Done = cli.md /
  adopting.md present it as a security posture, not a fallback.
- **Publish prebuilt to npm** — consumers would install only `octokit` (no
  devDeps, no `prepare`), and npm versions are immutable. Largely obsoletes
  the two items above. Done = `npm publish` in the release flow + scaffold
  pins the npm package.
- **Signed tags** (minor) — closes the edited-release-notes /
  moved-tag social-engineering channel completely.
- **Ruleset intent check** (minor) — `protect-main` carries a
  `pull_request` rule the maintainer bypasses; decide whether that's the
  intended bootstrapping posture or should start binding.
